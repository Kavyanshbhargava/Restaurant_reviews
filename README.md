# Restaurant_reviews

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to analyze restaurant customer reviews and classify them as positive or negative sentiments. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess raw text data and train a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment prediction.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: The project involves cleaning and preparing the text data by removing noise, tokenizing, stemming, and removing stopwords.

Text Vectorization: CountVectorizer is used to convert the text data into a format suitable for machine learning models.

Sentiment Classification: A Naive Bayes classifier is used to predict sentiments (positive or negative) of restaurant reviews.

Model Evaluation: The model is evaluated based on accuracy and tested with new reviews to predict customer sentiment.

Technologies Used:
Python
